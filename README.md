Online I mainly go as Indy, Indygo or Indygowithay. People have confused Indygo with a Y as it should be (but I have it written together) for Indygo wit hay and at a glance as Indy go away (which is what I've named my second channel that I havent touched in ages)

I'm very interested both in creative and logical video games such as Minecraft and Scrap Mechanic, as well as in video game development. I've been a Scratch user for over 5 years and over the laste couple of years I've been trying to get into 'real' game engines. I've been using Blender for over 3 years now and, as you can see on my youtube page, I'm trying to prepare for starting to try to make that into some type of content creation with a my own 3D stylization. I have many more interests but I think these are the biggest ones, at least at the moment. 

I identify as enby (Nonbinary) and I go by any pronouns, but prefer They/Them. As for my sexuality I'm really not sure. I think I'm like asexual, aromantic, something, but we just gotta wait and see until puberty is done idk and idc anymore.
